# rock-paper-scissors
 
This project is based from one of the tutorials that I've watched on YouTube to learn JavaScript (link:).

I have made some changes/additions such as:

1. Making it more responsive (not yet finished I think).
2. Added a round selector for players to chose how many rounds they want to play the game.
3. Fixed a bug where a player can still click a button while the hands are still animating (or generating result).


Might make some changes in the future particularly on the design.
